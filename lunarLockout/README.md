Lunar Lockout is a logic solitary board game for children 7 and
up. The board is a _m_ by _n_ grid with _p_ pieces. One piece is
distinguished: the avatar. The goal is to place the avatar at the
center of the grid without losing any pieces. All pieces, including
the avatar, move in the same way. A piece is allowed to move
horizontally or vertically only next to another piece, which prevents
it from falling of in space.
